This Slack is meant to connect gophers from all over the world in a central place.
There is also a forum: https://forum.golangbridge.org, you might want to check it out as well.
We have a few rules that you can see here: http://coc.golangbridge.org.

To share code, you should use: https://play.golang.org/ as it makes it easy for others to help you.

Here's a list of a few channels you could join:
